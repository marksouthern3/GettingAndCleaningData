In order to produce the tidy dataset ("tidydata.txt"), run the run_analysis.R script using R version 4.2.2 with the dplyr package version 1.0.10 loaded. For the script to run correctly, the original "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones" dataset that can be found at "http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones" should be present in a directory called "UCI HAR Dataset" in the current working directory.

The script merges the test and training datasets, extracts only the mean and standard deviations of each measurement, and calculates an average of these variables for a given test subject and activity. This is the data that is output in "tidydata.txt".
